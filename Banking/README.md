# Java OOP Portfolio 🚀

Hey there! 👋 I'm Daniyal, a passionate Java developer, and this is my hands-on journey through Object-Oriented Programming. Here you'll find real, working projects that demonstrate how I apply OOP concepts to solve practical problems.

## 🏦 What's Inside

### 💳 Payment System
A complete payment gateway that processes transactions through different payment methods. This was my first deep dive into abstraction and interfaces - building a system where multiple payment types can work together seamlessly.

**What I learned:**
- How abstract classes define common behavior
- Why interfaces create flexible contracts
- The power of polymorphism in real applications

### 🏦 Banking System 
A full-featured banking application that manages different account types with real business logic. This project challenged me to think about inheritance hierarchies and generic programming.

**Features that work:**
- ✅ Savings accounts with interest calculations
- ✅ Current accounts with overdraft protection  
- ✅ Fixed deposits with maturity tracking
- ✅ Loan accounts with EMI processing
- ✅ Secure transfers between accounts
- ✅ Customer management system

## 🛠 My Tech Journey

When I started these projects, I was learning OOP concepts in isolation. But I quickly realized that real programming is about making these concepts work together:

**Abstraction** - Creating the `BankAccount` base class that defines what all accounts can do
**Inheritance** - Building specialized accounts like `SavingsAccount` and `LoanAccount` 
**Interfaces** - Implementing `InterestBearing` for accounts that earn or charge interest
**Generics** - Building `AccountManager<T>` to handle any account type safely
**Polymorphism** - The same transfer method working across all account types

## 🎯 See It in Action

The banking system isn't just theoretical - it actually runs! Here's what happens when you execute the demo:

```
🚀 DAD Bank System - OOP Demo

=== ACCOUNT OPERATIONS ===

💳 Savings Account Demo:
Account Holder Name: Ali Khan, Account Number: SAV001, Balance: 5000.0
Deposit Successful! 
Withdrawal Successful!
Annual Interest: 220.0

💰 Fixed Deposit Demo:
Account Holder Name: Sara Ahmed, Account Number: FD001, Balance: 20000.0
You got Penalty of 500.0 for early withdrawal (real banking logic!)

🔄 Transfer Demo:
Transfer successful: true
Account SAV001: 5000 → 4500
Account CUR001: 10000 → 11000
```

## 💡 Building This Portfolio

I built both the payment system and banking system in about 6 hours of focused coding. The challenge wasn't just writing code - it was designing systems that are:

- **Scalable** - Easy to add new account types
- **Maintainable** - Clean separation of concerns
- **Professional** - Production-ready code structure

The most satisfying moment was seeing all the OOP pieces click together and create a working banking application that handles real business logic.

## 🌟 Why This Matters

These projects represent my transition from writing code to building systems. Each class, each interface, each generic constraint was a puzzle piece that eventually formed a complete, working banking application.

I'm proud of how far I've come - from understanding individual OOP concepts to making them work together in real applications.

## 🚀 What's Next

I'm constantly expanding this portfolio with new projects that challenge my skills. Next up: multi-threading, design patterns, and Spring Framework applications!
